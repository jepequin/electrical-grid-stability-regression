# Electrical Grid Stability Regression
This if the final project fot the Supervised Machine Learning course by Coursera (www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-regression). The goal of this project is to train linear models (including Lasso) to predict the stability of a 4-node star electrical grid (electricity producer is in the center).

## Description
Renewables are infiltrating our electric power supply at an fast pace. In order to integrate them into the grid a new system called Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC) has been proposed [1]. DSGC is a system implementing demand response, its goal is to help achieve a balance between electricity supply and demand so the grid remains stable.

The stability of the grid depend on several factors:

- Price elasticity (gamma): how much a participant is willing to adapt his consumption/production.
- Reaction time (tau): the delay between price change and adaptation to it.
- Power consumed/produced.

Based on these attributes we can predict:

- Grid stability.
